**TM-CoSim** is the first digital hardware-software co-simulation tool for validating the functionality and learning efficacy of Tsetlin Machine training RTL. The tool runs both a software golden standard and the user’s prospective RTL hardware concurrently. The random stimuli required for training can be provided either from the hardware or software processes such that the TM system state in both hardware and software can be verified over a training period. The tool’s primary objective is to facilitate faster development of TM training implementations in hardware with a framework supporting concurrent development of hardware and software.

Updates comming soon...
